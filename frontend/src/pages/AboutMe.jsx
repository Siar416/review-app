          I'm an aspiring who enjoys solving problems with code. <br />
          <br />
          Our lives are becoming more dependent on technology. My dream is to
          help carve the path forward by building dynamic and responsive web
          applications. My background is in customer service and transportation,
          allowed me to see the impact that high-quality software can have. This
          has inspired me to pursue a career path as a Web Developer. The
          possibilities are endless, with a little creativity and curiosity who
          knows what's next.
